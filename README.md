### Project Overview
The Real Estate Price Prediction project is a data science and machine learning initiative designed to predict real estate prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. This project aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience by walking through each step of building a machine learning model, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment through a web-based interface.

### Objectives
* To develop a machine learning model capable of predicting real estate prices based on specific features.
* To create an end-to-end pipeline that includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
* To build a user-friendly web interface where users can input property details and receive real-time price predictions.

### Project Structure

**The project is organized into several key components:**

Model: Includes Python notebooks for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. This is where the core machine learning tasks are executed, including linear regression and hyperparameter tuning.
Server: The backend server is developed using Python Flask, which handles requests from the front end and communicates with the trained model to provide predictions.
UI: Contains the code for the web-based user interface. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this front-end provides a simple way for users to enter property details and receive predicted prices.
